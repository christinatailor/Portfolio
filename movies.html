<h1>Movie Trailer Review</h1>
<p> I will write server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and movie trailer url. I will then serve this data as a webpage allowing visitors to review movies and watch trailers.</p>
<p>On this website, you can review the trailer for "13 Going on 30", "To All The Boys I've loved Before", "Coraline", "Princess and the Frog", and " The Lizzie McGuire Movie". These are among my favorite Movies. The link to this movie trailor review website is below. Here, you will be able to see the link to the Youtube trailer, where to find a copy of these movies, release date, and a section for your review.</p>
