<h1>Item Catalog </h1>
<p>I will develop an application that provides a list items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.</p>
<p>Users will be able to list music supplies, acting supplies, sewing Supplies, craft Supplies, and art supplies. I chose these categories for the website because I love the Arts. I used to act in high school. I love crafting as well. I have knitting equipment, a sewing machine, and an overlocker machine. So, I've decided to build something for crafters. It is more for sharing inventory and taking inventory. Not for buying. </p>
