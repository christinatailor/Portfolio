<h1>SF Neighborhood Map</h1>
<p>First, I want tofstart by saying this is the project I am most excited for. I am happy to be able to share some of the places in San Francisco that I would like to visit. I will develop a single-page application with the neighborhoods/places in SF. I would like to visit. To add additional functionality to the application, including map markers to identity popular location and places I would like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations; and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. I will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations.( a street view image, articles, yelp, etc)</p>
<p>I have never been to SF. But, I wanted move there ever since I saw how beautiful it is. I, for one, am a big fan of the beach and I've always wanted to live in a beach city. Although Baltimore is on the water, it does not have swimmable water. So, I saw that SF did along with a few hiking spots as well. I will include some nice spots in SF, as well as some popular spots like the Painted ladies. This Website will be linked below, along with an SQLite document of some of the places in California that I want to visit.</p>
