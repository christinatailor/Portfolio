	<h1>Christina's Portfolio Website</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Christina Williams. I am a sociology major at Morgan State Univarsity. I started learnign how to code Sophmore year with HTML. However, I didn't finish learning the language. I then in my junior year decided to give coding another shot with python. I learned the language on my own. I LOVED learning python and used coding as a way to cope with stress during that year. With all the of the changes going on having coding to help, later turned into my passion. I built this website as way to show my coding skills. This is one of five websites built.</p>
	<p>In this website, There will be links to the four other websites. The first is a movie tailor review website. The second is an item catalog. The third is a neighborhood map. The fourth is my resume. On the left is the Navbar, so that you can access these websites.</p>
